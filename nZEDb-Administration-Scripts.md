nZEDb has a rich variety of scripts that automate many administrative tasks. We strongly suggest that you take the time to browse the scripts found in the **misc/testing/** directory and familiarise yourself with the various possibilities. In general, whenever each script is called without parameters it will display a small summary of it's function and input parameters.

The scripts are loosely grouped by function into several sub-directories.
