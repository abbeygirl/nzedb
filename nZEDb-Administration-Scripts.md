nZEDb has a rich variety of scripts that automate many administrative tasks. We strongly suggest that you take the time to browse the scripts found in the misc/testing/ directory and familiarise yourself with the various possibilities. In general, whenever each script is called without parameters it will display a small summary pf it's function and input parameters.
